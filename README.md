 About This Task
This task was my introduction to using Git and GitHub.  
I learned how to create a public repository, organise my files properly, and push my work using basic Git commands.

All the files for this task are inside the **1.3P** folder of this repository.

 About the Website I Created
For this activity, I built a simple website using HTML and CSS and JavaScript .  
The website is a basic example to show that I understand:

- How to structure a webpage  
- How to apply styling  
- How to manage project files  
- How to upload everything to GitHub correctly  

It gave me hands-on experience and made the learning process more enjoyable and practical.
